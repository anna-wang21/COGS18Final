    "For my final project, I created a TravelBot named Kio! The purpose of the TravelBot is to inform people of experiences and opportunities at their next possible travel destinations. I also included a foods_dict to suggest foods to try out at each location in the response. Kio is only able to give information on  a few certain cities and countries but hopefully as time goes on, Kio TravelBot will continue to deliver sound suggestions about more and more locations. \n"
